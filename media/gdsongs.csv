Jesus of Suburbia,I'm the son of rage and love The Jesus of Suburbia The bible of none of the above On a steady diet of Soda Pop and Ritalin No one ever died for my Sins in hell As far as I can tell At least the ones that I got away with And there's nothing wrong with me This is how I'm supposed to be In a land of make believe That don't believe in me Get my television fix Sitting on my crucifix The living room in my private womb While the Moms and Brads are away To fall in love and fall in debt To alcohol and cigarettes And Mary Jane To keep me insane Doing someone else's cocaine And there's nothing wrong with me This is how I'm supposed to be In a land of make believe That don't believe in me At the center of the earth In the parking lot Of the 7-11 where I was taught The motto was just a lie It says home is where your heart is But what a shame Cause everyone's heart Doesn't beat the same It's beating out of time City of the dead At the end of another lost highway Signs misleading to nowhere City of the damned Lost children with dirty faces today No one really seems to care I read the graffiti In the bathroom stall Like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall And so it seemed to confess It didn't say much But it only confirmed that The center of the earth Is the end of the world And I could really care less City of the dead At the end of another lost highway Signs misleading to nowhere City of the damned Lost children with dirty faces today No one really seems to care I don't care if you don't I don't care if you don't I don't care if you don't care I don't care Everyone's so full of shit Born and raised by hypocrites Hearts recycled but never saved From the cradle to the grave We are the kids of war and peace From Anaheim to the Middle East We are the stories and disciples of The Jesus of suburbia Land of make believe And it don't believe in me Land of make believe And I don't believe And I don't care! Dearly beloved are you listening? I can't remember a word that you were saying Are we demented or am I disturbed? The space that's in between insane and insecure Oh therapy can you please fill the void? Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed Nobody's perfect and I stand accused For lack of a better word and that's my best excuse To live and not to breathe Is to die in tragedy To run to run away To find what you believe And I leave behind This hurricane of fucking lies I lost my faith to this This town that don't exist So I run I run away To the lights of masochists And I leave behind This hurricane of fucking lies And I walked this line A million and one fucking times But not this time I don't feel any shame I wont apologize When there ain't nowhere you can go Running away from pain When you've been victimized Tales from another broken home Oh you're leaving You're leaving You're leaving Are you leaving home?

Whatsername,Thought I ran into you down on the street Then it turned out to only be a dream I made a point to burn all of the photographs She went away and then I took a different path I remember the face But I can't recall the name Now I wonder how whatsername has been Seems that she disappeared without a trace Did she ever marry old what's his face I made a point to burn all of the photographs She went away and then I took a different path I remember the face But I can't recall the name Now I wonder how whatsername has been Remember whatever It seems like forever to go Remember whatever It seems like forever ago The regrets are useless in my mind She's in my head I must confess The regrets are useless in my mind She's in my head So long ago And in the darkest night If my memory serves me right I'll never turn back time Forgetting you but not the time
Song of the century,Sing us a song of the century That's louder than bombs And eternity The era of static and contraband That's leading us into the promised land Tell us a story that's by candlelight Waging a war and losing the fight They're playing the song of the century Of panic and promise and prosperity Tell me a story into that goodnight Sing us a song for me
21st Century Breakdown,"Born into Nixon I was raised in hell A welfare child Where the teamsters dwelled The last one born The first one to run My town was blind from refinery sun  My generation is zero I never made it As a working class hero 21st Century Breakdown I once was lost but never was found I think I am losing What's left of my mind To the 20th century deadline  I was made of poison and blood Condemnation is what I understood  Videogames of the towers fall Homeland security Could kill us all  My generation is zero I never made it As a working class hero 21st century breakdown I once was lost but never was found I think I am losing What's left of my mind To the 20th century deadline  We are the class of the class of '13 Born in the era of humility We are the desperate in the decline Raised by the bastards of 1969  My name is no one The long lost son Born on the 4th of July Raised in the era of heroes and cons That left me for dead or alive  I am a nation A worker of pride My debt to the status quo  The scars on my hands And the means to an ends Is all the that I have to show  I swallowed my pride And I choked on my faith I've given my heart and my soul I've broken my fingers And lied through my teeth The pillar of damage control  I've been to the edge And I've thrown the bouquet Of flowers left over the grave I sat in the waiting room Wasting my time And waiting for judgement day  I praise liberty The ""freedom to obey"" Is the song that strangles me Don't cross the line  Dream America dream I can't even sleep From the light's early dawn  Scream America scream Believe what you see From heroes and cons"
